Why, even with all our greatest minds, we could not have come close to replicating the ingenuity that was your Pythonic solution, not without the assistance of your own writings.~
== C0AMAGN ~And that is why you made Asclepios aware of my presence, and gave him the opportunity to get close to me?~
== C0AQINT2 ~Ah... that need not concern you any longer. I should inform you that Asclepios Cohval will no longer be a problem. The local authorities have discovered his body and confirmed his death. And with him gone, the threat of Titan will cease, now that the source has been eliminated.~
== C0AMAGN ~Will it, now? I was under the impression that Asclepios was but your collaborator. How else could his creation of Titan, derived from Lantanese alchemy, have come to spread here of all places?~

True, we made use of his services as an alchemist to further our own research, but the production and distribution of Titan was by his own making. We disavow his actions, and ended our association with him once his insane actions were known to us.~

== C0AQINT2 ~Besides... from what our agents have gathered, the foundations of his work which lead to the substance... the Pythonic solutions, has its roots in your own research. Or am I mistaken, honored professor? Perhaps this once-revered title, the "L'an Elementume Vitaer", was written by another's hand?~

== C0AQINT2 ~Most admirable.~
== C0AMAGN ~Let us get to the point. What is it that you Interitus want?~

We were a nation forged with the goal of advancing the realms through knowledge, boy. Can you truly claim that what you have done serves our original, sacred purpose?~
== C0AQINT2 ~But of course it does, sir.~

== C0AQINT2 ~While we have used such notions as our means of protection, we Lantanna have still been forced to suffer the consequences caused by the barbarism of others. The chaos of the Time of Troubles, when foul magic ran wild and tore the realms apart... even then, when we Lantanna could have been the saviors of many, we could have taken a rightful position of power, yet our narrowminded leaders did nothing, while the world beyond overlooked us as always. Does the level of ignorance not disgust you?~
== C0AMAGN ~That is how you justify your actions? Perhaps you have forgotten what makes a researcher. Our work is precious for its own sake, not for petty gains such as personal standing.~
== C0AQINT2 ~Nor do I care about the approval of these barbarians. But you should look at yourself, professor. For all your knowledge, you should be in a position fit for your greatness, with innumerable students as your side... yet here you are, alone, living in squalor, gathering knowledge around those for whom it serves nothing.~

== C0AQINT2 ~That, I fear, I cannot tell you. As any skilled player would know, one does not reveal their hand until the opportune moment. Not unless you are willing to choose a side, and support our noble cause. As a Lantanna, you would be more than welcome.~

== C0AQINT2 ~Do you find my words amusing?~
== C0AMAGN ~I beg your pardon. It is just that I have not seen such rigid, shallow thoughts coming from another of the homeland for many, many years. I presumed the passing of times, and lessons taught by past failures, may have eroded away at the same intentions that brought you to such depths.~

The unsanctioned distribution of unstable Titan, sequestering the Eleventh Workshop's prototype automation...~
== C0DEDAL ~And there is the matter of your attempts on the life of my young niece.~
== C0AQINT2 ~Your Eminence, sir, a moment... I believe the long journey has taken leave of your senses. These are some rather heavy accusations you are imposing, and quite unfounded. Feeble as we are now, the Interitus still owes all that we are now to your benevolence.~
== C0DEDAL ~Enough, Otho. What you have done of your own accord, and its consequences, will be evaluated in due time. I am here for the results of your work, no more. The "L'an Elementume Vitaer", if you will.~
== C0AQINT2 ~Of course, of course. Returned to its rightful owner, as it should be. Along with the newly-acquired research, though it is no doubt primitive compared to the magnificent works of your former teacher, or High Artificer Glaphyra... rest her soul.~
== C0DEDAL ~...~
== C0AQINT2 ~Ah... I take it you prefer not to be reminded of your late sister, Your Eminence. Forgive me for my impertinence.~
== C0DEDAL ~That is all in the past, Otho. We Lantanna look to the future, and never allow our failures to cloud our judgment. You still understand this simple creed, I hope?~
== C0AQINT2 ~I... well, of course I do, Your Eminence. My pride as a member of the homeland is without question.~
== C0DEDAL ~Good. Then you and all under your command are to cease all your current activity and return with me to Lantan, without delay.~
== C0AQINT2 ~What?!~
== C0DEDAL ~I have been patient, Otho. Where our kin see naught but the crimes of your predecessors, I offered you the benefit of the doubt, that you would faithfully serve the land you claim to love when given the opportunity. And while I do not condone the beliefs of your organization, your contribution up to now has been of undeniable merit.~
== C0DEDAL ~However... while I am willing to compromise on many things, your recent actions have gone beyond the terms of our cooperation. Our duty is to the homeland, and while that may mean we must be prepared for the potential threat of the outerlands... that does not equate to deliberately sowing discord, nor using innocents as your disposable test subjects.~
== C0DEDAL ~And... turning our own creations upon another Lantanna, putting further weight on your past sins... you have crossed a line, Otho, one which I cannot overlook.~
== C0AQINT2 ~Please, Your Eminence. I am willing to acknowledge my errors in judgment. Perhaps we overstepped in our experimentation with your teacher's research... but Interitus would never act against Lantan, nor any Lantanna who calls it home.~
== C0DEDAL ~These games of deception are beneath us. I am well aware that the Eye of Akintaer was believed lost in the Great Ice Sea, along with my niece, six years ago. To find out that it has been in your possession all this time... you have kept many secrets from me.~
== C0AQINT2 ~Ah... I see. It seems that I have underestimated your information network. You may have taken us under your wing, but it seems even then, you still have never trusted us fully.~
== C0DEDAL ~You have had as much of my trust as is deserved. I offered you a chance... a choice not to repeat your mistakes, and you have chosen wrongly. This must end, Otho. No more.~
== C0AQINT2 ~End? No, I fear it cannot end so easily, not while our nation's safety hangs by a thread... as a fellow Lantanna, surely you would be willing to hear my case, before rushing to a decision?~
== C0DEDAL ~...~

Few have the vision of those like yourself, who are wise enough to truly see the threat that looms beyond us. That darkness will consume us as well, one day, should we not act.~
== C0AQINT2 ~You may question our methods, but you may never doubt our loyalty. We live to serve the interests of our home, yet that service requires more than to simply protect ourselves. What our people need is not a shield, but a blade. After all... what do you carry your blade for, Your Eminence?~

== C0DEDAL ~No.I expect that not only you, but every member of the homeland would hold the same viewpoint. That is natural—we Lantanna are adepts of many trades, but war has never been among them. We have a natural aversion to war and conflict, yet our lack of understanding of it has made us complacent.~

== C0DEDAL ~Enough. You need not explain, as I understand fully.~
== C0DEDAL ~In truth, knowing that your time out of Lantan has hardened you brings me little joy, Aurelia. Our blood relation may be distant, but I remember your upbringing well, as you have been Kairos's favored child since your birth.~
== C0DEDAL ~From the age of three, you had already shown your talent in learning. By adolescence, you had awed each and every tutor with your memory and affinity at innovation. By the time you had finished your studies at the Sambaran academy, every guild in Lantan had offered you a place in their circle. You are considered a prodigy in every sense, and given the privilege befitting your ability.~
== C0AURA2P ~That's... uncle, I never—~
== C0DEDAL ~You misunderstand, Aurelia. I do not intend to criticise you. If I had my way, all inspired minds of our homeland should have the same. I only wish for you to understand that it has always been the goal of those who have nurtured you to keep you within Lantan, so that your gift could be used in turn to enrich the nation. That... was Kairos's wish, most of all.~
== C0AURA2P ~Papa... but he always supported my wishes. Even when I decided I wanted to leave Lantan, he...~
== C0DEDAL ~Indeed. When you declared, in your youth, that your aspiration was to use your knowledge to aid not only Lantan, but the world, your father chose to give you his utmost support, even giving the approval for you to travel the world.~
== C0AURA2P ~I never knew...~
== C0DEDAL ~And I agreed with him. Do you remember what I told you, the day the Eleventh Workshop finished the creation of your bow?~
== C0AURA2P ~"A weapon forged in Lantan must always be prepared to be held to protect the ideals of the Lantanna".~
== C0DEDAL ~Corrrect. But I never told you against whom we must be protected from. I believed, in seeing the world, that you would eventually find the answer. And have you?~
== C0AURA2P ~I... I'm not sure.~
== C0DEDAL ~I expected as much. It is a difficult question to answer. But there is one here who may teach you better than myself.~
== C0ALUNA ~...~
== C0AURA2P ~Luna?~
== C0DEDAL ~You are not the only one who has come to understand much of the world outside of Lantan. Since your departure, the church of Gond has appointed Luna as spokeswoman for the Ayrorch, and as you came to know those from the outerland through your travels... she has become exposed to many who came to Lantan of their own initiative.~
== C0ALUNA ~That'll do, uncle. I'll... I'll tell her myself.~
== C0ALUNA ~Since I became spokewoman, it's been expected of me to meet those from all over the realms. On the surface, it's to establish friendly relations, but in reality, it's to gauge the intentions of those who are seeking to know about us. As a priestess, I've learned how to sift through who can be trusted, and who have... other intentions.~
== C0AURA2P ~I... think I understand now. Luna, you've seen threats... those who covet what we have, our knowledge and creations...~
== C0ALUNA ~*nods*~
== C0ALUNA ~More than that, I've seen... how those who are ignorant of our ways look down upon us. If they sought our knowledge for enlightenment, or improvement, even if it's just for themselves, that I could understand... but as time went on, all I saw were more and more who simply saw what we made as tools and weapons, to use for their own greedy and self-centered purposes.~
== C0ALUNA ~It made me angry. And eventually, even though I would never support their ways... I began to understand the logic of those who hated everything outside of the homeland so much.~
== C0AURA2P ~That was when you decided to support uncle?~
== C0DEDAL ~On the contrary, I came to her. I feared for Luna's state of mind should no one intervene, and gradually informed her of my own goals to ease her mind. She has given me the support she can offer as a high priestess of the Gondar church since then.~
== C0AURA2P ~But... why? Uncle, why would you do all this... without the knowledge of the Ayrorch? If you care about the homeland, then shouldn't you—~
== C0DEDAL ~To answer that... perhaps I should ask a hypothetical of your leader instead. <CHARNAME>, if I may have a moment of your time.~

== C0AURA2J ~...I can't deny that I feel hurt, uncle. You once taught me that no invention of Lantan should ever be primarily viewed as a weapon. To believe so would be to betray our identities as Lantanna... that's why, when I saw all of this, and what you were planning, I couldn't believe my eyes.~
== C0AURA2J ~I don't believe your actions were that of betrayal. I know, in your own way, your zeal in protecting our home has never changed.~
== C0AURA2J ~However... uncle, I still believe your methods are ultimately wrong. Even should you have succeeded, and ensured Lantan would never be threatened by outside ambition and greed... the cost being paid would be the Lantanna's current way of peace, which has been the foundation of our principles for as long as we have existed.~
== C0DEDAL ~Yes... perhaps you are right. Succeed or fail, I would be no less of a traitor regardless, for I have committed a far greater sin than the simple endangerment of the homeland. I have betrayed the lasting endeavors of our people, the desire to further our knowledge to move the realms forward... and I have known that since the beginning, from the day I tainted the purity of our arts with blood, in my belief that I would empower us in return.~

It is perhaps for the best that you and I do not share the same family name, for it may lessen the scrutiny that you and Kairos may face once I am sentenced.~

== C0AURA2J ~My aunt... would be sad to see the position you are in now.~
== C0DEDAL ~She would never have agreed to this... any of this. That, I know. But it is because of that, the gentle nature of those such as she, and those others who we have lost due to the ambitions of those impure of heart... that, which I could no longer endure.~
